## Abstract
Lifecycle reliability management for large-scale PV systems: component reliability estimation, system-level Reliability Block Diagrams (RBDs), spare-parts planning, and lifecycle cost analysis. We evaluate key components (modules, controllers, inverters, batteries), construct series/parallel RBDs for utility-scale plants, estimate spare inventories via probabilistic failure modeling, and assess long-horizon economics using standard LCC metrics. The workflow demonstrates how reliability targets and redundancy decisions impact cost and availability for utility-scale PV.

## Repository layout

## Methods (brief)
- Component models (e.g., exponential/Weibull) and time-dependent reliability.
- System reliability via RBDs (series/parallel/k-out-of-n abstractions).
- Spare parts planning with probabilistic failure counts (Excel).
- Lifecycle cost analysis (discounted cash flows; CAPEX/OPEX; replacements).

## Reproduce
Open the Excel workbook in Excel and follow the steps noted in the report.
